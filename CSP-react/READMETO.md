The future value of a 529 plan that involves both an initial lump-sum investment and ongoing regular contributions is calculated by combining two formulas: the future value of a present sum and the future value of an annuity. The combined formula is:\(FV=PV(1+i)^{n}+\left[\frac{R\left((1+i)^{n}-1\right)}{i}\right]\times (1+i*{type})\)The optional factor \((1+i*{type})\) is included to account for whether payments are made at the beginning or end of the period. Formula Components Variable Description\(FV\)The Future Value of the 529 plan.\(PV\)The Present Value or the initial lump-sum investment amount (can be 0 if no initial sum was invested).\(R\)The regular periodic payment amount (e.g., monthly contribution).\(i\)The interest rate per period (annual rate \(\div \) number of compounding periods per year).\(n\)The total number of periods (total years \(\times \) number of compounding periods per year).\(i*{type}\)Set to 0 if payments are made at the end of the period (ordinary annuity), or 1 if payments are made at the beginning of the period (annuity due). Most online calculators use the beginning of period (annuity due) for regular savings goals.Simplified Formulas For a single, initial investment only:\(FV=PV\times (1+i)^{n}\)For regular, periodic contributions only (no initial lump sum):\(FV=\left[\frac{R\left((1+i)^{n}-1\right)}{i}\right]\times (1+i*{type})\) Due to the complexity of these calculations, online financial calculators are often used to project the future value of a 529 plan and run "what-if" scenarios.
